# Analyzing-CIA-Factbook-Data-Using-SQL

In this project, we'll work with data from the [CIA World Factbook](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/), a compendium of statistics about all of the countries on Earth. The Factbook contains demographic information like the following:

* `population` — the global population.
* `population_growth` — the annual population growth rate, as a percentage.
* `area` — the total land and water area.

We'll use SQL in Jupyter Notebook to analyze data from this database.
